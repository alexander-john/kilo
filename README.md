## Purpose of this project
This project has taught me a lot about various technologies. For starters the libraries used were as ancient as can be. But I never knew the terminal had it's own collection of libraries.
When you start programming in the terminal you learn really quickly how dark the depths of system programming can go. I was not aware of all the different technologies that were available.
Also, this project was straight to the point. No fancy libraries or file structure. Just plain C and a compiler. Out came a text editor with basic features light tect highlighting and search.
This project was very difficult to follow along and I'm sure I fell asleep while coding a couple times but it taught me a lot about programming stamina as well. This project is about 1000 lines
and it honestly felt like 100k lines. The amount of research after every 20 lines I had to do just to keep up would deter any aspiring programmer. But I walk away 1000 lines smarter than I was before.
I now have 2 books on systems programming that has a bit of information about some of the libraries used. Also, I now have a reference on how to build a complete project. I'm sure there is more I 
could mention but being able to go through the struggles and come out with more resources is the main goal for me whenever I work through a project and this was a true example of that.
